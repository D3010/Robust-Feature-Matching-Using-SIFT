# 🔍 SIFT Feature Detection and Matching  
**A Python-based implementation of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for keypoint detection and matching**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases an in-depth implementation of the **SIFT algorithm**, a cornerstone technique in computer vision for identifying distinctive keypoints in images that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination. The solution demonstrates both a **manual reconstruction** of key SIFT stages and **OpenCV’s built-in SIFT** for robust feature matching between image pairs.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Understand the theory and architecture behind the SIFT pipeline.
- Construct scale-space representations using a **Gaussian pyramid**.
- Detect keypoints via the **Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG)** technique.
- Match feature points across images using **OpenCV's SIFT + BFMatcher**.
- Visualize keypoint distributions and their matches effectively.

## 🏗️ Key Components

### 🧠 1. Gaussian Pyramid Construction  
A **multi-resolution representation** of an image, built by applying Gaussian blurs of increasing intensity and progressively downsampling the image across **octaves and scales**. This simulates scale variations in objects.

### 🔺 2. Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) Pyramid  
Created by subtracting adjacent blurred images within the same octave of the Gaussian pyramid. This technique efficiently approximates the **Laplacian of Gaussian** and identifies blob-like structures.

### ✨ 3. Keypoint Detection  
Local extrema (minima and maxima) in the DoG pyramid are identified by comparing each pixel with its 26 neighbors across 3D scale-space. Only points above a **contrast threshold** are retained as valid keypoints.

### 🧩 4. Feature Matching using OpenCV  
For real-world applications, OpenCV’s `SIFT_create()` is utilized to detect and describe features, followed by **Brute Force matching** with L2 norm. Matched keypoints are visualized for interpretability.
